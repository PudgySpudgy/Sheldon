This program is an attempt to create the worldwide sensation party game:

ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS, LIZARD, SPOCK.
Well, at least the first three. I'll try to incorporate the rest as I learn.

Initial creation of index.html with basic boilerplate verbiage.
Initial creation of index.js.

7/5/2022 Changes
:: WIP code from previous week deleted as it became apparent that nested if loops were not the right path.
Attempts to debut were fruitless, and discovered that the code was being read w/o curly braces, despite being necessary. Constructed a workable program, one line at a time. And the commit on 7/5/2022 appears fully functional for the Rock Paper Scissors TOP request.
